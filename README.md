VGuideu Health bot using Azure

Project Title*:VGuideu Health assistant with [Azure Health Bot](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/health-bot/overview)

Problem Statement/Opportunity*: We have a lot of doctors in our neighborhood these days. However, those who are preoccupied with their daily life find it difficult to locate a nearby hospital in an emergency. So, here's your virtual assistant, who can give you the contact information for doctors in your area who can help you with your health problems.
Project Description*: When we are prone to certain health concerns, we will experience various symptomatic reactions in our bodies. We might be hesitant to contact a doctor since the concerns appear to be minor, yet there would be a lack of someone knowledgeable about health.
As a result, we will provide you the nearest doctor based on your location
